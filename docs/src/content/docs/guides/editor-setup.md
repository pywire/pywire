PyWire provides first-class support for VS Code through our official extension.

## VS Code Extension

The PyWire extension provides:
- Syntax highlighting for `.wire` files.
- IntelliSense for the Python block.
- Real-time error reporting.
- Go to definition and hover support.

To install:
1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "PyWire".
4. Click **Install**.

## Other Editors

While VS Code is our recommended editor, you can use any editor that supports standard Python development. The `.wire` file format is designed to be readable even without specialized extensions.
