Components in PyWire are just `.wire` files. Any `.wire` file in your `components/` directory (or other configured paths) can be used as a custom HTML tag.

### Your Task

1.  Switch to `components/MyButton.wire` in the file tree.
2.  Add a `<style scoped>` block to add a hover effect (e.g. `opacity: 0.8`) to the button.
3.  Observe that the button in the preview updates immediately.

In PyWire, directory structure often dictates availability. Files in `components/` are automatically available to your pages.
