As your app grows, you'll want to split it into multiple files. PyWire makes this easy with a standard directory structure.

### Multi-file Structure

- Files in the `pages/` folder (like `pages/index.wire`) are your main pages.
- Files in subdirectories can be imported as components. For example, `components/Button.wire` is imported as `import components.Button`.

### Your Task

In this exercise, we've already set up `index.wire` and an initial `components/Button.wire`. 

1. Try adding a new file! Click the `+` icon next to the **components** folder in the file tree.
2. Name it `Card.wire`. 
3. (Notice that if you tried to name it `bad_file.txt`, the tutorial would prevent you!)

Once you've seen how the file tree works, notice that `pages/index.wire` is already importing `Button`.
