By default, files in the `pages/` directory are served at a route matching their filename. You can override this using the `!path` directive.

### Your Task

1.  At the very top of `pages/homepage.wire`, add `!path "/home"`.
2.  Add 'secret' somewhere in the `<h1>` tag.
3.  Notice that the preview (which is already pointed at `/home`) now shows the content of this file instead of a 404.

Directives like `!path` allow you to decouple your file structure from your URL structure.
