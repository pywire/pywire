Sometimes you'll have project files that should not be modified, like configuration or core logic.

### Immutability

Notice the `config.py` file in the tree. It has a **lock icon** next to it.
- If you click it, you'll see the code, but you **cannot type** in the editor.
- You also **cannot delete** this file because it is marked as protected.

### Your Task

Make sure the app is working correctly. The preview should display "App Name: My Super App". 

Try changing `pages/index.wire` to add a bit of styling to the App Name span. As soon as the "My Super App" text appears in the preview, the tutorial step will be complete!
