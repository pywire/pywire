        # Let's check how scripts/build works again. 
        # scripts/build does `cd docs && pnpm build` and `cd src/pywire/client && pnpm build`.
        # So we probably just need pnpm available.
        # But we probably need to install dependencies in those folders first?
        # The script doesn't seem to have install steps.
        # Let's assume we need to install dependencies.
        # actually, looking at scripts/build again:
        # cd docs && pnpm build
        # cd src/pywire/client && pnpm build
        # It assumes deps are installed.
        # We should probably run scripts/install? No that's python.
        # We should probably do pnpm install in the steps.
